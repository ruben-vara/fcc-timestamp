# FreeCodeCamp Timestamp Microservice

This is the first API project on the freeCodeCamp APIs and Microservices Certification.

You can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check if the string is either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: July 31, 1990), and return accordingly.
